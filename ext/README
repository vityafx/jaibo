This is an extensions directory.
Extensions directory divided into categories - games, life, other.

Games is goodly explain by it's name.
Life - this category should contain extensions that helps people in life. Weather forecast, news etc.
Other - cvs-hooks, link handlers, polling bots, i.e. non-games and non-life extensions.

Each extension has a dependency - jaibo-api.jar. With jaibo-api jar it may use database services through jaibo-api, so
extensions may need also sqlite-jdbc-3.8.1.jar as dependency. Each dependency should be placed in in the root directory
of extension, for example for games.pickupbot in "/ext/games/pickupbot/".

After placing all the dependencies in correct directory it can be compiled by running 'gradle build'.
